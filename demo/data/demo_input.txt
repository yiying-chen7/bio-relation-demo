Title: Gut microbiota cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular implications
Abstract: The gut microbiota plays crucial roles in cholesterol metabolism and cardiovascular health. Species from the Oscillibacter genus were associated with decreased fecal and plasma cholesterol levels. Using functional prediction and in vitro characterization of multiple representative human gut Oscillibacter isolates, we uncovered conserved cholesterol-metabolizing capabilities, including glycosylation and dehydrogenation. These findings suggest that Oscillibacter bacteria can convert cholesterol into various metabolites that may influence host lipid profiles and cardiovascular risk.

Title: Clostridium sporogenes aromatic amino acid metabolism 
Abstract: The gut bacterium Clostridium sporogenes obtains its energy by utilizing amino acids in pairs, coupling the oxidation of one to the reduction of another through the Stickland reaction. All three aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine) serve as substrates for this metabolic pathway. Our results reveal that this pathway produces twelve compounds, nine of which are known to accumulate in host serum. These metabolites include indole derivatives from tryptophan metabolism and phenolic compounds from phenylalanine and tyrosine degradation.

Title: Bifidobacterium lactose utilization and beneficial effects
Abstract: Bifidobacterium species are prominent members of the human gut microbiota known for their beneficial health effects. These bacteria efficiently utilize lactose and other complex carbohydrates through specialized enzymatic pathways. The metabolic activity of Bifidobacterium produces short-chain fatty acids, particularly acetate and lactate, which contribute to maintaining gut barrier function and modulating immune responses. Additionally, Bifidobacterium strains can synthesize B vitamins, including folate and vitamin B12, supporting host nutritional status.

Title: Bacteroides fiber degradation and butyrate production
Abstract: Bacteroides species are major fiber-degrading bacteria in the human colon, possessing extensive carbohydrate-active enzyme systems. These bacteria break down complex dietary fibers into simpler compounds, with some strains capable of producing butyrate, a key short-chain fatty acid. Butyrate serves as the primary energy source for colonocytes and exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. The metabolic cross-feeding between Bacteroides and other gut bacteria creates a complex network that influences overall gut health and host metabolism.

Title: Probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus and immune modulation
Abstract: Lactobacillus acidophilus is a well-studied probiotic bacterium that produces various bioactive compounds with immunomodulatory effects. This organism ferments glucose and other sugars to produce lactic acid, creating an acidic environment that inhibits pathogenic bacteria. L. acidophilus also produces bacteriocins, antimicrobial peptides that specifically target harmful microorganisms. The strain's ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells and stimulate cytokine production contributes to enhanced immune function and resistance to infections.
